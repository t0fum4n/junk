CVE ID: CVE-2023-2255
Description: Improper access control in editor components of The Document Foundation LibreOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links to be loaded without prompt.

This was inconsistent with the treatment of other linked content in LibreOffice. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.7; 7.5 versions prior to 7.5.3.

Description: Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in the spreadsheet component of The Document Foundation LibreOffice allows an attacker to craft a spreadsheet document that will cause an array index underflow when loaded.

This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.6; 7.5 versions prior to 7.5.1.
